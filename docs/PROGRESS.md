# Current Progress

## Current Status

- Godot C# project initialization is complete.
- `Main.tscn` exists and is set as the main scene.
- `Main.cs` is attached to the root `Node2D` in `Main.tscn`.
- `Main.cs.uid` exists and matches the script UID referenced by `Main.tscn`.
- `Main.cs` draws an 8x8 board and displays one player unit and one enemy unit.
- No selection, movement, attack, enemy turn, or win/loss logic has been implemented yet.
- No animation or art pass is planned for the first prototype.

## Next Milestone

Implement tile clicking and player unit selection.

Done when:

- Clicking a board tile can resolve its grid coordinate.
- Clicking the player unit tile selects the player unit.
- The game gives simple feedback when the player unit is selected.

- Confirmed `docs/GOALS.md` and `docs/PROGRESS.md` exist and are the active planning documents.
- Confirmed `project.godot` points `run/main_scene` to the UID used by `Main.tscn`.
- Confirmed `Main.tscn` root node is named `Main` and has `Main.cs` attached.
- Confirmed `Main.cs` only contains a startup `Hello World!!!` print and no gameplay systems yet.
- No prototype todo item in `docs/GOALS.md` is complete yet.

### 2026-05-26T16:05:13+0800

- Implemented the first visual prototype in `Main.cs`.
- The game now draws an 8x8 board using simple rectangles.
- Added one player unit at grid position `(1, 1)` and one enemy unit at grid position `(6, 6)`.
- Player and enemy units are shown with different colors and simple labels.
- Verified the project with `dotnet build test_trpg.sln`: build succeeded with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
- Updated `docs/GOALS.md` to mark completed board and unit display items.
