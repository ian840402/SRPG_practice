# Current Progress

## Current Status

- Godot C# project initialization is complete.
- `Main.tscn` exists and is set as the main scene.
- `Main.cs` is attached to the root `Node2D` in `Main.tscn`.
- `Main.cs.uid` exists and matches the script UID referenced by `Main.tscn`.
- `Main.cs` draws an 8x8 board and displays one player unit and one enemy unit.
- Board tile clicks now resolve to grid coordinates.
- The player unit can be selected by clicking its tile.
- Selection feedback is shown with a highlighted tile, status text, and console output.
- No movement, attack, enemy turn, or win/loss logic has been implemented yet.
- No animation or art pass is planned for the first prototype.

## Next Milestone

Implement selected-unit movement to valid empty tiles.

Done when:

- After selecting the player unit, clicking an empty tile attempts movement.
- Movement is allowed only within the player's move range.
- Movement uses Manhattan distance and does not allow diagonal movement.
- The player unit cannot move onto the enemy tile.

### 2026-05-26T15:58:42+0800

- Confirmed project documentation rules are in place in `AGENTS.md`.
- Confirmed `docs/GOALS.md` and `docs/PROGRESS.md` exist and are the active planning documents.
- Confirmed `project.godot` points `run/main_scene` to the UID used by `Main.tscn`.
- Confirmed `Main.tscn` root node is named `Main` and has `Main.cs` attached.
- Confirmed `Main.cs` only contains a startup `Hello World!!!` print and no gameplay systems yet.
- No prototype todo item in `docs/GOALS.md` is complete yet.

- Added one player unit at grid position `(1, 1)` and one enemy unit at grid position `(6, 6)`.
- Player and enemy units are shown with different colors and simple labels.
- Verified the project with `dotnet build SRPG_practice.sln`: build succeeded with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
